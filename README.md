# OBJECTSTORE2019 - ONLY TESTED ON LINUX DESKTOP
Project for the operative system class I've taken at my university (in C language).
Basically it simulates an object store, implementing basic functions such as storing/deleting/retrieving.
Further information are in the pdf file called "Relazione" (italian language only, for the moment).
Feel free to ask me any doubt about it!
